# Rearmed ModLoader

 ***Mod loader for AWW Rearmed***

The mod loader is still very new and has a lot of work left. 

Currently mods can be created freely however the mod loader does not help a lot and the modder would have to do a lot of manual work at the moment.

The mod loader fails to show windowed mode properly so it forces the game to remain on fullscreen.

***MOD READING***

The mod loader uses a base mod to read all other mods. The mods are read from the *AWW_Mods* folder in the form of SWF. Each mod SHOULD have a txt file that contains the mod's name, description, and whether they are enabled on default. The mod loader (base mod) saves the txt data in the roaming folder so the user's settings are saved.

The UltraUltimateSword mod should act as a template for other mods.

As more work is done on the mod loader more info will be added here.
